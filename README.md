# Predicting Survival on the Titanic with Machine Learning and Website Data Mining


## Introduction
In this project, we address the challenge of predicting the survival of Titanic passengers using machine learning techniques through supervised learning and data mining from a web page. The combination of these technologies will allow us to create an efficient predictive model based on historical information and data collected in real time. It should be noted that in this project there is a csv which must be matched with the data of the web page.

## Objectives
- Data Mining: Obtain relevant information from a web page about the Titanic passengers.
- Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare data for use in machine learning models.
- Develop Predictive Models: Use machine learning algorithms to predict the survival of the passengers, this project will address Decision Trees and Random Forests.
- Model Evaluation: Measure the performance of the model and optimize it to improve its accuracy, recall, among other metrics.
## Methodology
1. Data Extraction:

- We will use pandas to collect data on passengers directly as they are present in table format on the web page.

2. Data Preprocessing:

- Clean inconsistent or incomplete data
- Use data matching techniques.
- Convert categorical data to numerical data.

3. Model Development:

- Divide data into training and test sets.
- Test machine learning algorithms, decision trees and random forest.
- Use cross-validation techniques to evaluate the performance of each model.
4. Evaluation and Optimization:

- Use metrics such as accuracy, recall and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the selected model.
